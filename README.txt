GENERAL INFO:
1. All code examples are in ruby programing language (ruby 2.0).
2. To check if ruby is already installed on your computer run in terminal 
ruby -v.
3. If ruby is not installed please follow instruction how to download and install: [ruby]www.ruby-lang.org
4. hostelworld is root project folder
5. Code was tested on MAC OS 10.9.5 and should works on UNIX based system.
6. Firefox 40.0.2 to check selenium-webdriver tests

Question 1

Anagram checker program are in two versions - longer and shorter.
In order to use least amount of code there is a short version. 
Longer version folows OOP principles.

Anagram checker programs are in hostelworld/anagram_checker folder.
Anagram checker documentation generated by rdoc is in hostelworld/anagram_checker/doc. 
To open documentation use index.html.
To generate documentation run in terminal 'rdoc --all <file_name>'
e.g. rdoc --all anagram_checker_short_version.rb

Before run: 
anagram_checker_short_version.rb
anagram_checker_short_version.rb
must be executable 
To make a file executable on UNIX like systems run 'chmod +x <file_name>'
e.g. chmod +x anagram_checker_short_version.rb

Run:
On UNIX like systems in terminal run './<file_name>'
e.g ./anagram_checker_short_version.rb
and follow instruction 

QUSETION 2
There is a problem because code is in java ;-)
Seriously - in my opinion code result in stack overflow due to infinity recursion. 

the problem in my opinion is:
if(wordToCheck == "hostleworld" ) { name = "hostleworld";} 
might be
if(wordToCheck != "hostleworld" ) { name = "hostleworld";} 

Question 3 - UI testing using selenium-webdriver
Using selenium-webdriver along with cucumber folder: cucumber_selenium-webdriver
Install following gems: selenium-webdriver, cucumber, rspec
from terminal: 
gem install selenium-webdriver cucumber rspec
Or go to hostelworld folder and type bundle install (all gems from Gemfile will be installed)

To check if gems are installed type in terminal:
gem list --local

If all gems are installed go to cucumber_selenium-webdriver and then type in terminal:
cucumber --format html --out report.html
Then first test should start and logs in terminal window should appear 
Every time when tests starts report.html file will be overwritten
Please check report.html for test result (this type of report is build-in cucumber)

In scenario where available properties should be sorted by name - i get all names displayed on page and check if they are displayed alphabetically.

In scenario where available properties should be sorted by price i get prices only for dorms category and then check if they are sorted ascending. 

To check if scenario handle fail and how report.html will be look like in this case please change in features/lib/page_object_model.rb:
from: @elements=@driver.find_elements(:css=>'.price .dormroom')
to: @elements=@driver.find_elements(:css=>'.price a')
and save file

In this case all prices for available properties (inluding private one) will be checked if are correctely sorted and test scenario will be failed. 
  
API testing 
I don't have much experience with webapp API automation testing 
(except testing rails or sinatra application)
I would probably use in this case Net:HTTP with rspec.
Unfortunately I'm not able to provide a quick solution especially in java/groovy/Jmeter. Need some time to gain some familairity with tools...
